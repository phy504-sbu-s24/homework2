1. In this repo you'll find a C++ program called `numbers.cpp`.  As written,
   it will read in numbers from the user and add them to a vector.  This will
   continue until the user enters a negative number.  At that point, the program
   will return the sum of the input numbers.

   *Your task*: modify this program to return the average and the standard deviation
   of the numbers.
